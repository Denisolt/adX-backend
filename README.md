adX is a novel tool for different vendors (cafe, restaurants, stores, etc) to engage people in collecting ads or coupons. On adX vendors can select how many NEO tokens they want to distribute, location of the advertisement and the actual image of the ad or coupon. Regular users utilize the android app to check the map and go to specific location. The moment they reach to destination, users click on the second window and can see the ad flowing in the air. By clicking on the image, they save the coupon and receive 50% of the tokens that vendors decided to give away. adX is a fun way to collect ads and coupons and get paid in NEO as well.
